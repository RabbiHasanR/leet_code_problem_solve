# Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []
# Example 3:

# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz
 

# Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?
